☆hello☆<br>
it's been almost a year since i last wrote one of these, which feels unbelievable. time has eluded me for many months. 

my partner wrote in an essay years ago abt epistemological breaks, a thing that changes everything.  
this, all of this, is a thing that has already changed everything. nothing like this has ever occurred within my bandwidth of understanding. revolution caught us like a rug being pulled from under our feet. we’re on the floor struggling to get back up, grabbing on to things around us to aid us in returning to our feet. i can’t wait until we’re back up & we’ve thrown out the rug. 

my heart feels like it's trying to come up my throat many hours of the day.
i’m also having trouble finding the words (this gesture is helping already) when there are so many words that i’m tumbling over everyday, repetition washing over meaning over understanding over feeling. i feel like i can’t possibly settle into any words when they fall so flat of what i’m feeling & i find myself constantly frustrated with myself for using words so frivolously in the past because the words feel less full now as if i was to use them to describe this they wouldn’t mean anything, they would just wash away with the rest of the words.

have been thinking of love as something that you don’t need others to bear witness to
a type of secret
maybe why love has felt so elusive to me in the past, everyone who carries it has been holding it close
