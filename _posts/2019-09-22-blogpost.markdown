hello people&respective machines
<p>09/28<br>
	i've decided that a blog where other humans can choose if they want to consume what i expel into the void is better than inhabiting social platforms for the time being. so i will be posting a web of thoughts/projects/in progress work into the mindscape from time to time. thanks for coming xo
<br>
<br>
btw this><a href="https://landscapesfromanother.world/">landscapes from another world</a>
is my favorite blog rn other than my blog. <a href="http://serafinalvarez.net/">serafin alvarez</a> is a real genius human imo & has a lot of cool blogs/projects.
