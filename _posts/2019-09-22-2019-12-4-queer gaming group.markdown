☆queer gaming!!!☆<br>
recently, i have started collaboratively organizing a queer gaming group in new york that plays & corresponds about games made by QTIPOC. we're working on a list of game designers & games that we love & want to experience together, which i have included below. please email me if you want to play with us/help organize or have anything to contribute to our archiving<3
<br><br>
★an amazing reference has been the <a href="https://lgbtqgamearchive.com">lgbt game archive!</a> from the schwules museum in berlin. they are doing amazing (gay) archiving work.
<br><br>
★<a href="http://neveralonegame.com/">never alone</a> is a game i've been wanting to play that was made by and about the Iñupiat people, an alaskan indigenous community. this game has recieved very disparate reviews & has had a lot of critical engagement from the games community and the academic community. <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/video/jodi-a-byrd-video-games-indigeneity-settler-colonialism">jodi byrd discusses here</a>. 
<br><br>
★one of my fav writers & gamemakers, <a href="http://slimedaughter.com/">porpentine heartscape</a> is a must on this list. she queers game making in every way possible!
<br><br>
★<a href="http://abtec.org/#about">abtec</a> -aboriginal territories in cyberspace- is collaboratively involved in the creation of games & virtual worlds, and have so many beautiful projects on the go!
<br><br>
<a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/game/dys4ia/">dys4ia</a> made by anna antropy about the experiences of being transgender!
<br><br>
serafin alvarez's work is adjacent to games; this is a nice <a href="https://serafinalvarez.itch.io/maze-walkthrough">maze walkthrough</a> by him on itch.
<br><br>
★robert yang is an extremely prolific and <a href="https://debacle.us/">seductive</a> game developer who teaches at the nyu game center rn.
