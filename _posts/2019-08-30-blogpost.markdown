<h4>hello again people&respective machines</h4>
<p>i've decided that a blog where other humans can choose if they want to consume what i expel into the void is better than inhabiting social platforms for the time being. so i will be posting a web of thoughts/projects/in progress work into the mindscape from time to time. thanks for coming xo
