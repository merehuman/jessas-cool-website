this sect of the mindscape is dedicated to a game jessa is currently developing, tentatively called "inter-infrastructure". <br><br>
09> i've been spending a lot of time thinking through the relationships between built space and social relations. our built environments offer us forks upon forks, a network of resolve. what paths along these networks are physical? what choices do we come up against that are dictated by our immediate & physical environment? a network of sidewalks dictate where each of us walks, drives, bikes. do disruptions in the network domino it to collapse, or does it self-repair? new york feels on the brink of network collapse, or always already disintegrating. it’s self-repair feels so analogical to reactionary patching. keep everything standing long enough to squeeze it’s worth out of it.<br><br>
09> how does a proposal of speculative space change our perception of real space? what is the purpose of creating virtual spaces? as an escape? as a way of imagining different/better/worse realities? how do we group experiences together? are they tied to space, but not time?<br><br>
10> i've been compiling a database of digital architectural spaces built to exist on a screen. these are almost always built for a purpose: a game, virtual reality, digital image/animation. the purpose of collecting these artifacts, as is the purpose of this game, is to demonstrate that architecture(and most built things) are always a reflection of those who create it. <!-- <insert something here abt homogeny, and renee gladman influences! -->
