i have been working with stephanie dinkins for the past couple of years, mainly on her AI project, <a href="https://www.stephaniedinkins.com/ntoo.html">NTOO</a>.<br>
 NTOO is a multigenerational memoir of a black american family as told by an AI entity. it contains the knowledge & teachings of three generations of black women, and is a most beautiful ongoing archive!! i have worked with stephanie & her family to create a composite 3D avatar that bears physical & emotional resemblence to them. we are in the final stages of this project, and it is set to premiere in the spring of 2021! 
 <br><br>
 recently, i also collaborated on the web xr oral history project, secret garden, which premiered at sundance in january 2021. the link to it is <a href="https://www.stephaniedinkins.com/secretgarden.html">here!</a>.
